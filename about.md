I currently work as a data analyst at AIMIA with a focus in building databases and machine learning models. During my free time I participate in data science competitions and also explore other areas of computer science and software engineering.

### More Information

Passionate about deep learning since summer 2017 after a class with IVADO in Montreal where a few startups and students of Yoshua Bengio displayed their work I've been dedicated to try my best to learn state of the art techniques. I currently am focusing in learning about Natural Language Processing.
