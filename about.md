I currently work at AIMIA where I help building databases and machine learning models. During my free time I participate in data science competitions and also explore other areas of data science.

### More Information

A few lines about my background:  
I studied in Statistics at University of Montreal during which I worked with R on a research project on GLMs. During this time I was a teacher assistant as well as a tutor for a lot of students in maths or statistics. I really enjoyed this and still appreciate trying to teach complex subjects to all audiences.  
After my Master degree I started to work at AIMIA as a data analyst where I got really involved in predictive modeling. This is where I began to code machine learning and data science in Python.

Passionate about deep learning after encountering it in a class at an IVADO summer school, I've been dedicated to try my best to learn state of the art techniques both in deep learning and traditional machine learning.

This blog is both an opportunity for me to really ciment what I learn (writing/teaching is best to do that) while also have a platform to display my work and projects.
