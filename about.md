I currently work as a data analyst at AIMIA with a focus in building databases and machine learning models. During my free time I participate in data science competitions and also explore other areas of computer science and software engineering.

### More Information

A few lines about my background:  
I studied in Statistics at University of Montreal during which I worked with R on a research project around GLMs. During this time I was a teacher assistant as well as a tutor for a lot of students in maths or statistics. I really enjoyed this and still appreciate trying to teach complex subjects to all audiences.  
After my Master degree I started to work at AIMIA as a data analyst where I started to get really involved in predictive modeling and started to code machine learning and data science in Python.

Passionate about deep learning after a class with IVADO in Montreal where a few startups and students of Yoshua Bengio displayed their work I've been dedicated to try my best to learn state of the art techniques. I currently am focusing in learning about Natural Language Processing.
